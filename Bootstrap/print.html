            <p>Yangon (formerly known as Rangoon) is the largest city in Myanmar (formerly Burma). 
                A mix of British colonial architecture, modern high-rises and gilded Buddhist pagodas define its skyline. Its famed Shwedagon Paya, a huge, shimmering pagoda complex, draws thousands of pilgrims annually. The city's other notable religious 
                sites include the Botataung and Sule pagodas, both housing Buddhist relics.</p>
            <p>Mandalay is a city and former royal capital in northern Myanmar (formerly Burma) on 
                the Irrawaddy River. In its center is the restored Mandalay Palace from the Konbaung Dynasty, surrounded by a moat. Mandalay Hill provides views of the city from its summit, which is reached by covered stairway. At its foot, 
                the Kuthodaw Pagoda houses hundreds of Buddhist-scripture-inscribed marble slabs.</p>
