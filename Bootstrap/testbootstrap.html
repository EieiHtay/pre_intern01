            <p> Yangon (formerly known as Rangoon) is the largest city in Myanmar (formerly Burma). 
                A mix of British colonial architecture, modern high-rises and gilded Buddhist pagodas define its skyline. Its famed Shwedagon Paya, a huge, shimmering pagoda complex, draws thousands of pilgrims annually. The city's other notable religious 
                sites include the Botataung and Sule pagodas, both housing Buddhist relics.</p>
