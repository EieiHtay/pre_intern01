        <h2 id="city1">Yangon</h2>
        <p>Yangon (formerly known as Rangoon) is the largest city in Myanmar (formerly Burma). 
            A mix of British colonial architecture, modern high-rises and gilded Buddhist pagodas define its skyline. Its famed Shwedagon Paya, a huge, shimmering pagoda complex, draws thousands of pilgrims annually. The city's other notable religious 
            sites include the Botataung and Sule pagodas, both housing Buddhist relics.</p>
        <h2 id="city2">Mandalay</h2>
        <p>Mandalay is a city and former royal capital in northern Myanmar (formerly Burma) on 
            the Irrawaddy River. In its center is the restored Mandalay Palace from the Konbaung Dynasty, surrounded by a moat. Mandalay Hill provides views of the city from its summit, which is reached by covered stairway. At its foot, 
            the Kuthodaw Pagoda houses hundreds of Buddhist-scripture-inscribed marble slabs.</p>
        <h2 id="city3">Taunggyi</h2>
        <p>Prior to British colonisation, Taunggyi was a small village of a few huts. The area lay on a wide 
            shoulder of the Sittaung Hills of the Shan Hills and was populated by the Shan people at the time. 
            The signs of the original village 
            of Taunggyi are long gone, but nearby villages can still be discerned quite easily.
            During British occupation, the town became the chief city and capital of the Southern
             Shan States. Taunggyi's modern development began in 1894, when the British moved their 
             administrative offices from Maing Thauk (Fort Stedman) on the eastern shores of Inle Lake 
             to the higher elevation of Taunggyi, for health and geographical reasons. 
             Although geographically within the state of Yawnghwe, the town was denoted as a "notified area" 
             by the British, exempt from the Sawbwa's administration. By 1906, there existed a thousand houses. Because of civil unrest throughout the Shan States during the early 1900s, Taunggyi served as the chief garrison for military police. Taunggyi also served as
             a supply centre for the Shan States, and catered to persons of many nationalities.</p>
